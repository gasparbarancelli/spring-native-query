# Spring Native Query

Increase your productivity and code quality with Spring Native Query, the library that revolutionizes native query access in Spring Boot applications. Designed for those seeking flexibility, organization, and power in SQL manipulation, our library delivers a superior experience for modern projects, including full support for Spring Boot 4.

## Why choose Spring Native Query?

- **Complete separation between SQL and Java:** Keep your native queries outside Java classes, making code easier to read, maintain, and evolve. SQL is organized in its own files, keeping your project clean and decoupled.
- **Template Engine for dynamic SQL:** Leverage engines like Freemarker to create dynamic queries, adapting SQL according to received parameters. This eliminates manual string concatenation and reduces risks of errors and vulnerabilities.
- **More readable and sustainable code:** With separation and templates, Java code focuses on business logic, while SQL can be easily reviewed and tested independently.
- **Advanced support for Spring Boot 4:** Take advantage of the latest Spring Boot features, with seamless integration and optimized resources for modern projects.
- **Automatic result mapping:** Easily transform native query results into DTOs or entities, without boilerplate.
- **Flexibility for multiple databases:** Adapt your queries for different databases with ease, using the power of templates.
- **Easy testing and maintenance:** With decoupled queries and reusable templates, testing and evolving your project becomes much simpler.
- **Security and organization:** Reduce SQL Injection risks and keep your code secure and well-structured.
